# World_Weather_Analysis
PLANMYTRIP is a top travel technology company that specializes in internet-related services in the hotel and lodging industry. Jack is the head of analysis for the user interface team. He's asked you to help him collect and present data for customers via the search page, which they will then filter based on their preferred travel criteria in order to find their ideal hotel, anywhere in the world.  To perform this task, you will be using a Jupyter Notebook and the CitiPy module to get the cities for more than 500 random latitudes and longitudes. Then, you will perform requests on the OpenWeatherMap API and retrieve the JSON weather data from these cities. The weather data will be added to a Pandas data frame, where you will use Matplotlib to create a series of scatter plots to show the relationship between the latitude and a variety of weather parameters for over 500 cities around the world.
